WePay onboards merchants in just a few form fields thanks to its patented risk engine Veda (tm), which scours the web and pulls as many data points related to that merchant including but not limited to social data. This allows WePay to develop risk profiles for merchants instantly. The results are faster payouts for legitimate merchants and better fraud prevention.

        Let's all (really all) talk about what this Ruby conference is for,
        why you're here, and what you're going to do to go home thrilled with
        your experience. First, listen to my perspective - I say this
        conference is for strengthening and broadening our sense of
        ourselves as Rubyists so that we can learn from each other and
        move forward as a community. Then wield your markers and
        stickies to start to express and share your ideas about what
        will make SCRC14 amazing for you and for us

        Bring your instruments! In honor of our late friend Jim Weirich, we will be dedicating the stage to a jam session. 
        Jim was known for bringing his ukelele to conferences and hosting impromptu one.  
        So we're going to have a spot in our schedule for others to continue this trend.

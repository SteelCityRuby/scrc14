    * Ongoing exposure - SCRC 2012 and 2013 were sold out months in advance
    * Continued exposure - All talks are recorded and posted to the internet

    * Our anti-harassment policy fosters a safe, professional conference

      me.”
    * We strive to make sure our sponsors get their money’s worth. Sponsoring
      SCRC is a personal relationship with us, the organizers. We’re never more

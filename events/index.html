<p>Let's all (really all) talk about what this Ruby conference is for, why you're here, and what you're going to do to go home thrilled with your experience. First, listen to my perspective - I say this conference is for strengthening and broadening our sense of ourselves as Rubyists so that we can learn from each other and move forward as a community. Then wield your markers and stickies to start to express and share your ideas about what will make SCRC14 amazing for you and for us

If you are into a little friendly competition bring your favorite board.There will be second room setup  where you can challenge your fellow developers to a ??friendly?? game of what-have-you. In another room, there will be stimulating conversation,  witty jabs, and jokes of all sorts. Friends, co-workers, and new acquaintances alike can partake in dining and drinks, sharing an amazing view of the Pittsburgh skyline and Ball Park.

<p>Bring your instruments! In honor of our late friend Jim Weirich, we will be dedicating the stage to a jam session.  Jim was known for bringing his ukelele to conferences and hosting impromptu one.   So we're going to have a spot in our schedule for others to continue this trend.

        we are dedicated craftsmen who believe that iterative and Lean practices
        are the best approach to creating custom software applications that
        quickly deliver real business value. With on-site coaching, we transform
        companies and cultures by helping them embrace and adopt Agile
        development practices. In our development studio we design and deliver
        custom software, whether green-field or legacy systems, for customers
        ranging from startups to enterprises. Our home is a 120-year old
        steamship on Cleveland’s downtown shore of Lake Erie and as soon as you
        step on our boat, you realize that we think, act, work, and do
        differently.

        The Pragmatic Programmers is a company with a simple goal: to improve
        the lives of developers. We create timely, practical books, audio books
        and videos on classic and cutting-edge topics to help you learn and
        practice your craft. Our titles do not contain any Digital Restrictions
        Management, and have always been DRM-free; we pioneered the “beta book”
        concept; we’ll email your ebook to your Kindle and synch your ebooks
        amongst your devices via Dropbox, and you can re-download your purchases
        at any time. We’re here to make your life easier.

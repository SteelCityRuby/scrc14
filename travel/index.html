<p>For directions to the NHT, see its <a href="http://newhazletttheater.org/the-theater/directions/">directions and parking guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>The NHT is very close to the North Shore stadium neighborhood. The Pirates are out of town Friday and Saturday, but there is a Steelers pre-season game Saturday evening. Event parking rates may be in effect on Saturday.</p>
<P>There is a small amount of street parking near the theatre but we recommend parking in either:</P>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.alcoparking.com/parking/AllegCent.html">Allegheny Center Garage</a> - closer to the New Hazlett Theatre but closes at 8pm</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alcoparking.com/parking/NorthShore.html">North Shore Garage</a> - open until midnight and close to PNC Park where the party will be Friday evening</li>
</ul>
<h3>Open Development room with Internet access</h3>
<p>We will not have WiFi available in the whole venue (you’re going to be paying too much attention to the speakers, right?), but we will have a room we’re calling the <b>Open Development space</b> where you can go any time during the conference days for Internet access, to hack on something, pair with someone, get help or help someone with a programming problem, etc. Many attendees bring hotspots of some kind and might be willing to share if you ask politely.</p>
<h3>Eating</h3>
<p>As in the past, for lunch both days, we will be sending you out to sample Pittsburgh cuisine! There will be organizers and volunteers leading groups to various restaurants nearby like these! We assembled a <a href="http://is.gd/scrc_restaurant_guide">restaurant guide</a>.</p>

        Let's all (really all) talk about what this Ruby conference is for, 
        why you're here, and what you're going to do to go home thrilled with 
        your experience. First, listen to my perspective - I say this 
        conference is for strengthening and broadening our sense of 
        ourselves as Rubyists so that we can learn from each other and 
        move forward as a community. Then wield your markers and 
        stickies to start to express and share your ideas about what 
        will make SCRC14 amazing for you and for us

        Nearly all our larger scale applications end up with a utils 
        folder, module, or class. We all know them as our project's 
        junk drawers. The wayward place for motley code. In this talk
        we will explore these junk drawers, come to know their stories,
         and lay to rest the question: Does having a junk drawer in my 
         application make everything better or worse?

        Presenting a paradox involving two ruby strings which are 
        equal and constructed in ways that look very similar, but which
        ave different properties -- one of them is "html_safe" and the 
        other is not. The goal of the talk is to explore three things 
        about this paradox.

        We Rubyists reject unnecessary ceremony and complexity, always 
        striving to minimize complexity as much as possible without 
        sacrificing clarity. So why are we not using functional approaches 
        when object oriented approaches fail to go the last mile?

        Two thirds of honeybee hives have died out in Virginia. Is it 
        possible for us to devise a way of monitoring beehives in 
        remote locations to find the cause? Enter a raspberry pi +
         rails. Using a combination of this robust hardware and 
         software solution, we were able to successfully track, 
         monitor and provide reporting on the well-being of hives from 
         across the county. Find out how we used ruby, rails, solar 
         panels and other libraries to provide insight into this problem.

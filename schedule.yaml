        Let's all (really all) talk about what this Ruby conference is for, 
        why you're here, and what you're going to do to go home thrilled with 
        your experience. First, listen to my perspective - I say this 
        conference is for strengthening and broadening our sense of 
        ourselves as Rubyists so that we can learn from each other and 
        move forward as a community. Then wield your markers and 
        stickies to start to express and share your ideas about what 
        will make SCRC14 amazing for you and for us

        Nearly all our larger scale applications end up with a utils 
        folder, module, or class. We all know them as our project's 
        junk drawers. The wayward place for motley code. In this talk
        we will explore these junk drawers, come to know their stories,
         and lay to rest the question: Does having a junk drawer in my 
         application make everything better or worse?

        Presenting a paradox involving two ruby strings which are 
        equal and constructed in ways that look very similar, but which
        ave different properties -- one of them is "html_safe" and the 
        other is not. The goal of the talk is to explore three things 
        about this paradox.

        We Rubyists reject unnecessary ceremony and complexity, always 
        striving to minimize complexity as much as possible without 
        sacrificing clarity. So why are we not using functional approaches 
        when object oriented approaches fail to go the last mile?

        Two thirds of honeybee hives have died out in Virginia. Is it 
        possible for us to devise a way of monitoring beehives in 
        remote locations to find the cause? Enter a raspberry pi +
         rails. Using a combination of this robust hardware and 
         software solution, we were able to successfully track, 
         monitor and provide reporting on the well-being of hives from 
         across the county. Find out how we used ruby, rails, solar 
         panels and other libraries to provide insight into this problem.

        How does a blind person even use an iPhone? Learn through personal stories 
        why accessibility matters and some simple things you can do. Additionally, 
        learn about some RubyMotion tools to improve accessibility both for sighted 
        and blind iOS developers.

        Where do Rubygems come from? We will trace the journey a Gem takes on its 
        way into your codebase, mapping paths through tools like RVM, rbenv and 
        Bundler. Along the way we will learn how these tools wrangle third party 
        Ruby code into place and what methods they share.

        Although Ruby is well-known for its use in popular consumer applications, 
        it also has been used for several years in major newsrooms such as The New 
        York Times and ProPublica to build "news applications" that display data, 
        serve APIs and help inform readers. This isn't a typical web development 
        environment: in newsrooms, deadlines can mean hours, not weeks, and often 
        involve unfamiliar datasets and the challenges of both real-time publishing 
        and archived material. In this talk I'll introduce developers to the unique 
        world of newsroom developers and some of the applications and tools they've 
        built using Ruby.

        We've got a lot of tools at our disposal to render data in all kinds of interesting ways: charts, tables, gauges, and so on. Yet most dashboards are designed for consumption by humans, and many users say they don't get a lot of value from these visualizations -- or even worse, they find them confusing to use. We're doing something wrong.
        In this talk, we'll describe the scientifically-validated attributes of great visualizations, point out some common antipatterns that we think you should avoid, and illustrate how to optimize for showing the most relevant facets of a dataset. Don't let your dashboard become another statistic!

        They don't pay us money. They don't understand the goals of the project. They don't even say "thank you". But studies and personal experiences have proven that users of open source software are more demanding than those same users who pay for software. Why?
        Understanding the "why" will help us discover the "how". How can we solve this problem? Because it's not a technical one - it's a cultural one.
